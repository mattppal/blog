Outside of work, I enjoy exploring technical projects. Often, I find the best motivator is to work with other passionate individuals on ideas that have real-world applications. One particularly fun & engaging way to do so is to _write_ about that which moves me.

Here's a sample of my freelance/fun writing (outside of this blog):

### Forthcoming

- Contributing to _Automating Data Transformation,_ a report to be released by [O'Reilly](https://www.oreilly.com/) in Q2, 2023 in collaboration with [Coalesce](https://coalesce.io).

### Hex

One of my favorite piecesâ€” I wrote about the data culture at AllTrails and how we used [Hex](https://hex.tech) to improve our analytics workflows.
