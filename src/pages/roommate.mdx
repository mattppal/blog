# 👋 Hi! I'm Matt

## Intro

Great to meet you! I recently relocated to the Bay Area from Asheville, NC and I'm looking for a roommate.

I'm a 27 year old data engineer at a small startup. When not at work, I enjoy fitness, climbing, and hiking. I also like to read and explore!

Here are a few things I'm looking for:

- **Area:** Santa Clara/Sunnyvale area ☀️
- **Budget:** $1.8-2.2k. Damn this isn't North Carolina 😮‍💨 😱
  - I'm willing to pay a bit more for a comfortable space, hence the high upper-range.
- **Qualities:** Similarly-aged male who is relatively quiet and clean. Likes to have fun!

If that sounds like what you're after, drop me a line! If not, I'm always down to meet cool people, so feel free to reach out if you're looking for a friend.
