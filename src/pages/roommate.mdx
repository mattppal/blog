# 👋 Hi! I'm Matt

## Intro

Great to meet you! I recently relocated to the Bay Area from Asheville, NC and I'm looking for a roommate.

I'm a 27 year old data engineer at a small startup. When not at work, I enjoy fitness, climbing, and hiking. I also like to read and explore!

If that sounds good to you, I'm in search of a male roommate with similar hobbies and interests. I'd prefer the Santa Clara area. My budget is **$1.8-2.2k/mo**.

If that _doesn't_ sound good to you, I'm always down to meet cool people, so feel free to reach out.
