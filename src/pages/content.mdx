## Coalesce

- ðŸ§‚ [Shaking up the "T" in "ELT"](https://coalesce.io/product-technology/automating-data-transformation-with-coalesce/)
- ðŸ¤– [Automating Data Transformation](https://coalesce.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/OReilly-AutomateDataTransformations.pdf): A report I ghost-authored on the current state of the modern data stack, with a focus on data transformation. This was a collaboration with O'Reilly Media.
- ðŸ¥³ [Data Fundamentals](https://coalesce.io/all-things-data/before-jumping-into-generative-ai-and-llm-ensure-data-fundamentals-are-in-place/): An article arguing for a focus on the _fundamentals_ of data analysis rather than the hype of generative AI.

    width="75%"

</div>

- ðŸ“Š [One Chart Forward, Two Queries Back](https://hex.tech/blog/iterating-in-analytics/): I had a blast working with the Hex team to discuss analytics workflows. I'm pretty opinionated about the data developer experience and I feel strongly that a focus on process can yield huge gains in analytics productivity.
- ðŸ¥¾ [Hex at AllTrails](https://hex.tech/blog/hex-at-alltrails/): One of my favorite piecesâ€” I wrote about the data culture at AllTrails and how we used [Hex](https://hex.tech) to improve our analytics workflows.

## Shipyard

I appeared on Captain's Compass #10 to talk a bit about data orchestration:

## Mage

In my role as a DevRel at Mage, I've created _a ton_ of resources and worked to overhaul our docs: here's a [before](https://web.archive.org/web/20230521044430/https://docs.mage.ai/introduction/overview) and [after](https://docs.mage.ai/).

### Demos

- [Magic Devcontainer](https://github.com/mage-ai/magic-devcontainer): a self-contained Mage demo, leveraging VSCode devcontainers to demo an end-to-end Mage pipeline.

### Presentations

- [UTDeM](https://www.meetup.com/utah-data-engineering-meetup/events/292397377): link forthcoming.
- [DataTalksClub](https://www.eventbrite.de/e/make-data-magical-with-mage-tickets-698259853017): see the presentation [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKALtxziBG0).
