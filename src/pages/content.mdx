Outside of work, I enjoy exploring technical projects. Often, I find the best motivator is to work with other passionate individuals on ideas that have real-world applications. One particularly fun & engaging way to do so is creating content!

Here's a sample of my work (outside of this blog):

### Coalesce

- [Automating Data Transformation](https://coalesce.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/OReilly-AutomateDataTransformations.pdf): A report I ghost-authored on the current state of the modern data stack, with a focus on data transformation.
- [Data Fundamentals](https://coalesce.io/all-things-data/before-jumping-into-generative-ai-and-llm-ensure-data-fundamentals-are-in-place/): An article arguing for a focus on the _fundamentals_ of data analysis rather than the hype of generative AI.

### Hex

    width="75%"

</div>

- [One Chart Forward, Two Queries Back](https://hex.tech/blog/iterating-in-analytics/): I had a blast working with the Hex team to dicsuss analytics workflows. I'm pretty opinionated about the data developer experience and I feel strongly that a focus on process can yield huge gains in analytics productivity.
- [Hex at AllTrails](https://hex.tech/blog/hex-at-alltrails/): One of my favorite piecesâ€” I wrote about the data culture at AllTrails and how we used [Hex](https://hex.tech) to improve our analytics workflows.

### Shipyard

I appeared on Captain's Compass #10 to talk a bit about data orchestration:

    allowfullscreen
  ></iframe>
</div>

### Mage

In my role as a DevRel at Mage, I've created _a ton_ of resources and worked to overhaul our [docs](docs.mage.ai). Here are a few things I think stand out.

- [Magic Devcontainer](https://github.com/mage-ai/magic-devcontainer): a self-contained Mage demo, leveraging VSCode devcontainers to demo an end-to-end Mage pipeline.
