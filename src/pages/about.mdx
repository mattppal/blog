I'm a member of the {SITE.team} Team at {SITE.company}. I graduated from Swarthmore College in 2018, where I majored in physics & economics— I also played baseball. I currently reside in {SITE.location}, but I've lived across the country, from the Smokies to the Uintas.

I enjoy using analytics to understand product and make data-driven decisions. I also find the engineering side fun— I love making things more efficient/building new tools. In my free time, I write and hack on fun projects, get outside, and do my best to become a better person.
