## The past year

For most, the past two years have been strange. I think we've all encountered unexpected challenges: personal, professional, & social.

Global events have brought about shifts in how we work and communicate. For many, this has resulted in more time alone with our thoughts. This is not an easy thing to face. Many, myself included, thought 2021 might be a return to normalcy. This was far from the truth.

A first reaction to this new reality was to drown out my own thoughts: keep myself distracted with external stimuli, whether good (hiking, biking, exercising) or bad (Netflix, social media).

I've found this to be wholly unsatisfying. The concept of avoiding the truth frightens me. I think this year was a chance to rediscover who I am. Confronting my feelings and resolving that uneasiness has been a long and painful journey, one that is not finished.

It was not comfortable or easy, but I'd like to take some time to reflect on that.

## 2021 Goals & Reflections

I set the following goals on December 31st, 2020:

- [ ] Form a better relationship with my family.
- [ ] Become a core employee at my previous workplace, break into data engineering.
- [x] Become more lean & improve my relationship with food.
- [ ] Get stronger, faster.
  - [ ] Row a 2k sub 7:00.
  - [ ] Sub 5:00 mile time.
  - [ ] C&J 150kg, SN 115kg.
- [x] Establish an inner circle
  - [x] Make 1-3 really good friends I can rely on.
  - [ ] Meet a girl (or two).
  - [x] Be someone dependable.
- [x] Learn about successful people, always be the first to try something new, grow personally.
  - [x] Read 24 books

### Reflections

Some of my goals were extremely broad and unquantifiable. Some were too optimistic. Some became irrelevant halfway through the year.

While I'm frustrated at my failure to accomplish these goals (and set reasonable expectations for myself), I'm taking these lessons into this year. Before I discuss 2022 goals, here are my thoughts on 2021:

- I'm extremely proud of the work I did building relationships with great people in 2021. I met some truly amazing people and changed the way I think about friendship.
- I learned _a ton_ about analytics engineering through my old employer (Storyblocks) and continue to learn daily.
- I started a new job at an amazing SaaS company (AllTrails). I improved the quality of my analyses and shifted into product rather than data engineering.
- I moved cross-country to Salt Lake City. I tried new experiences, met new people, and challenged myself to try different things.
- I nearly accomplished my strength goals (140 CJ & 110 SN). I believe that I might have been closer had I not moved in October.
- I read [25 books](https://www.goodreads.com/user_challenges/26952525) and learned a ton.

### What worked

- Honing in on extremely specific goals.
- Removing conflicting objectives and keeping my methods simple.
- Doing less.
- Making steady progress through consistent execution.
- Investing in activities that make me happy & keep me going.
- Spending time reflecting on my feelings.
- Prioritizing relationships with good people.

### What didn't work

- Setting vague and/or immeasurable goals.
- Burning the candle at both ends day over day.
- Putting myself in situations devoid of spontaneity.
- Living in a city where there were few people my age.
- Continually trying to fit in with the wrong crowd.

### Lessons learned

Going forward, I will be making my own decisions. I will prioritize those things that bring me joy and emphasize relationships. _Rome was not built in a day_. Consistency and balance take priority over long hours and moving to stay busy.

I truly want to make a difference in this world, but I realize that takes time. It's OK if I don't have a plan to bring that goal into reality right now. I will continue working to find my niche and understand how I can best create value. I will continue to show up and give my best everyday.

I will continue to be grateful for this amazing life.
