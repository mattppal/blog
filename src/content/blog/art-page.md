For the last few months, I've been sketching in pen & ink in my free time. I've found it incredibly cathartic. While I have no formal education in art, it's been fun to experiment and improve my drawings.

I've created a new [art](/art) page where I'll display my new sketches. I'm working to get a site stood up where I can create and sell prints. My goal is to share my hobby with those who are interested. I've found that to be a great motivator for progress.

In the future, I hope to attend art shows and informal craft fairs to sell prints, engage in the community, and learn more about what it means to create beauty. I'm stoked to start this new journey! 🙂
