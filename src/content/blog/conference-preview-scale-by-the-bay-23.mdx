## ToC

## Overview

I'm _super_ stoked to share a unique, independent conference with you all AND the opportunity to attend at a heavy discount (or for free!).

This is a _sponsored_ post, but I promise all the content within will be my honest and authentic take... Plus, who doesn't like **free** stuff?! Read on to learn more about the conference: its history, talks I'm excited about, and how you can _attend for free_.

## Scale by the what?

[_Scale by the Bay_](https://www.scale.bythebay.io/) might not have the notoriety of a Databricks or Snowflake Summit, _but_ it's cemented itself as an independent, professional platform for tech innovators.

Now, in its **tenth** year ðŸ¤¯, the conference is bringing you premier data & cloud content with [tracks](https://www.scale.bythebay.io/about) on _Software Engineering_, _Cloud Architecture_, _Data & AI_, and _Open Source Science_.

One of the coolest parts? It's in a historic venue (the [Oakland Scottish Rite Center](https://oaklandscottishrite.com/)) with _a ton_ of charisma, or rizz, as the kids say these days.

I'll talk a bit about what has me the most excited, then we can get to the giveaway. ðŸ¤‘

## Speakers & Talks

There's quite a [star-studded lineup](https://www.scale.bythebay.io/speakers) for the conference, so I highly recommend you check out the full list of speakers, but the `TLDR` is that _Scale By the Bay_ will feature speakers from companies like Netflix, Disney, IBM, Databricks, and Confluent, covering topics ranging from _building LLMs_ to _data engineering best practices_.

Here are a few that stand out to me:

### [Scaling Embeddings in Real-Time](https://www.scale.bythebay.io/post/zander-matheson-scaling-embeddings-in-real-time)

_Zander Matheson_

<div class="mx-auto w-1/4">
  <img src={zander.src} alt=""></img>
</div>

Zander, the CEO of Bytewax (a Python-native, highly scalable, and cloud-native stream processing framework), knows a thing or two about streaming.

While generative AI is great, LLMs are only as powerful as their models, which often have to be updated or rebuilt.

In his talk, Zander will show us just how Bytewax can help to create scalable real-time embeddings, which can be used to power bespoke, generative AI pipelines _in real time_.

### [Creating Context: Loading Your Life into a Vector Database](https://www.scale.bythebay.io/post/ben-church-creating-context-loading-your-life-into-a-vector-database)

_Ben Church_

</div>

_Hello, World_ examples are great, but they're often not that fun or personal. In this talk, Ben Church of Airbyte will walk us through how to extract personal data, transform it into embeddings, and load it into a vector database, providing an LLM with domain-specific context to power your life/business.

### [Apache Iceberg: Enabling an Open-lakehouse Architecture](https://www.scale.bythebay.io/post/dipankar-mazumdar-apache-iceberg-enabling-an-open-lakehouse-architecture-for-large-scale-analytics)

_Dipankar Mazumdar_

<div class="mx-auto w-1/4">

</div>

I've written a bit about [Delta Lake](https://mattpalmer.io../../assets/posts/what-is-delta/) as a framework for enabling a [Lakehouse Architecture](https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=https://www.cidrdb.org/cidr2021/papers/cidr2021_paper17.pdf), but Iceberg is a similar format that has a host of benefits.

I think it's _super important_ that we _all_ keep up-to-date on the latest data tools & tech. I'm looking forward to this talk by Dipankar, a Developer Advocate at Dremio, to learn more about lakehouse architectures and how Iceberg differs from solutions like Delta.

## Conference Workshop

Scale by the Bay _also_ features a headline workshop, designed to take you from zero-to-LLM-hero

### [Building production-ready LLM-powered applications](https://www.scale.bythebay.io/llm-workshop)

_Josh Tobin_

<div class="mx-auto w-1/4">
  <img src={josh.src} alt=""></img>
</div>

[Josh Tobin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/josh-tobin-4b3b10a9) of [Gantry](https://www.gantry.io/) & [Full Stack Deep Learning](https://fullstackdeeplearning.com/) will deliver the conference workshop: _Building production-ready LLM-powered applications_.

Josh will teach us how to build AI-powered applications from scratch, while following best practices to balance shipping quickly with building high-quality, production-ready applications your users trust.

Additionally, he'll walk us through a structured approach to AI app development loosely based on the test-driven development methodology used in traditional software engineering.

This is one you _won't_ want to miss: learn from the _best_ in AI when it's at peak hype. ðŸ˜‚
