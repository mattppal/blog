Lately, I‚Äôve been thinking about the future of product. In _Linchpin,_ Seth Godin describes _The Law of the Mechanical Turk:_

> Any project, if broken down into sufficiently small, predictable parts, can be accomplished for awfully close to free.

Now, this makes sense‚Äî the more open-ended the job, the more it pays.

Seth's example compared Encyclopedia Brittanica to Wikipedia‚Äî through project management (open-sourcing contribution), Wikipedia was built for free, or at least much closer to free than a team of 100 full-time editors.

Of course, Seth named the law after Amazon's "Mechanical Turk" service, which (in 2010) could execute tasks like audio transcription for $0.20 per minute through parallelization and assignment to remote workers.

Now, take that in the context of 2024. OpenAI's Whisper can transcribe your audio for $0.006 per minute and scales infinitely (or close enough). That's a 33x improvement.

So, who wins?

The leaders that _understand_ how to leverage the power of automation by _most efficiently_ breaking down their problems and, more importantly, make the smartest bets on PMF.

Now the important part:

>  **Product isn't changing** , this has _always_ been the case.

However, order-of-magnitude changes in efficiency mean the gap between the 1% and the 99% will get _much_ larger. Winners will be the ones that:

  1. Have the best ideas

  2. Use the new rules to _iterate_ on their ideas the fastest.




#1 is, of course, developer experience. So ‚Äúwinning‚Äù product looks like creativity + project management + developer experience.
