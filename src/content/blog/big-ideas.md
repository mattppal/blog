Every now & then, I'm obsessed by a Big Idea. It plants itself in my mind and I think about it day and night. I have a purpose.

I wake up early to develop it. I stay up late to improve it. I know the Idea will be great. I know it will solve a problem. It will make lives easier! Is it a product? Can I sell it? Will this be the next Stripe, Spotify, Strava?

A few weeks of work and I share my idea. There is praise. There are congratulations. It is put to use! People benefit. I am happy.

Slowly, we forget. The Idea is used less. Time passes: the problem is no longer relevant, a better solution is found, interest is lost. I am no different from those without Ideas.

I move onward, looking for the Next Big Idea.
