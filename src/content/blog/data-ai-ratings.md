## ToC

## Overview

My take is that a good conference experience should strive to distance itself from an airport as much as possible. You know, where everyone you speak to is after your money, and TSA agents and conference attendants are like long-lost siblings with their credential scanning and gruff expressions. And let's not forget the constant search for outlets and the aimless wandering in a sea of people. But hey, I'll leave it to the attendees to score Databricks and the Moscone Center on that scale. Now, onto my whimsical takes on the conference as a whole:

## Coffee

**Score:** ü§® / 10

Coffee should never require an essay-length comment, right? Just tell me if it's hot and caffeinated! Well, prepare for disappointment because the coffee availability was a rollercoaster ride. I ended up spending a fortune on $7 single origin pour overs at Blue Bottle. On the first day, there wasn't a drop of coffee in sight when I arrived late, leaving me yawning my way through the morning. Luckily, they got their act together on the second day and coffee magically appeared everywhere. It was like a caffeine miracle! But then, on the third day, they played hide-and-seek with the coffee schedule. I couldn't find a cup between 9:30 and 11:00 AM. Back to Blue Bottle I went! Interestingly, the coffee reappeared at 11:30. Talk about coffee mysteries! And when they did serve coffee, it was Peets, which was decent. When it wasn't available, there was a tiny kiosk at the Moscone Center selling $5 apples and brews. I mean, come on, I'm not about to pay five bucks for a Granny Smith. Thankfully, snacks became more abundant as the conference went on.

## SF

**Score:** üßñüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è / 10

Days one and two were all about full-on fog and gusty winds, but guess what? Day three surprised us with actual sunshine! Shout-out to Striim for organizing an outdoor event by the Bay and providing heaters. It was cozy, with cool views and tasty ceviche. What a mood changer!

## Talks

**Score:** ü§ì / 10

The talks were like a rollercoaster ride themselves. On day one, there was zero line management. All the talks were crammed into one of the twelve conference halls, and the lines snaked around like a maze. It got so chaotic that I ended up in the wrong talk after standing in a super long line. Then, I hopped into another line, only to find out it had reached capacity and I was left out in the cold (well, not literally, but you get the point). Kudos to the organizers, though, because they completely fixed this mess on day two. But seriously, why wasn't this anticipated on day one? The presentations didn't even allow for standing room (apparently, fire code regulations were to blame). Sometimes I like to stand and watch a talk, you know? Oh well. My favorite talk was by Oz Katz, the founder of lakeFS. The topic was "Delta-rs, Apache Arrow, Polars, WASM: Is Rust the Future of Analytics?" It was a perfect mix of humor and information. While I'm a bit skeptical about Rust replacing Python, I must admit that Rust-based Python packages are shaking things up (üêª‚Äç‚ùÑÔ∏è). Plus, the solutions presented by Oz in WebAssembly (WASM) piqued my interest. It's such an underrated tech (my coworker and I had no clue what WASM stood for üòÇ), but it seems super useful.

## Events & Socialization

**Score:** ü•≥ / 10

Ah, my favorite part of conferences‚Äîthe opportunity to meet passionate people and hear their stories. And boy, there was no shortage of sharp individuals to chat with. On Wednesday night, I had a conversation with a guest from Australia who noticed how Americans seem to spend money with zero self-control. As a recent Bay Area transplant, I couldn't argue with him. And this observation happened at the Chase Club, which is located court-side at the Golden State Warriors' home. Databricks went all out and rented the entire stadium for a performance by none other than Salt-N-Pepa. Maybe the Aussie guest was onto something after all.

Now, personally, I prefer low-key events. I didn't even know who Salt-N-Pepa were until some "distinguished" members of the community enlightened me. Just give me some tasty snacks and a room full of sharp data minds, and I'm happy to chat for hours. Renting out the entire Chase Center may have been impressive, but Salt-N-Pepa? Well, let's just say their pauses for the audience to sing along made it clear that a crowd of data nerds wasn't ready to go word-for-word with the Grammy-winning duo from 1995.

Oh, and speaking of performances, most technical authors fear their material will put people to sleep, but Matt & Joe should be proud that their content was more interesting than a live hip-hop show. Trust me, it's quite an accomplishment.

## Beef with Snowflake

**Score:** üò° Unlikely to recommend to a friend

If you drove on the 101 into SF, you'd think Snowflake was taking over the world with their billboards outnumbering Databricks 3-to-1. Sure, Databricks mentioned Snowflake in their slides and spoke about unifying frameworks, but it seemed like a shallow attempt at taking the high road, especially since they held their conference on the exact same day as their competitor. I mean, seriously? Let's not divide the data community, folks!

Competition should drive progress and unite the community. I get it, not everyone would attend both conferences (especially not for $2k each), but many vendors and data community members would have. Both companies disappointed me. We should be sharing solutions and improving the data experience as a community, rather than trying to throw the biggest party, invite the most famous guest speakers, or make the flashiest headlines. /rant

## Overall

I could have done without the very loud pop music being piped into every crevace of the Moscone Center, but a few quirks, I had a blast. I met amazing people and learned so much. But you know what my favorite part was? The Rivian parked in the Expo Hall!
