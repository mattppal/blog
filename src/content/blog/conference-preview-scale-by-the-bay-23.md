## ToC

## Overview

I'm _super_ stoked to share a unique, independent conference with you all AND the opportunity to attend at a heavy discount. This is a sponsored post, but I promise all the content within will be my honest and authentic take... Plus, who doesn't like free stuff? Read on to learn more about the conference: its history, talks I'm excited about, and how you can _attend for free_.

## Scale by the what?

![](/posts/conference-preview-scale-by-the-bay-23/top_front_page_sbtb_2023.png)

[_Scale by the Bay_](https://www.scale.bythebay.io/) might not have the notoriety of a Databricks or Snowflake Summit, _but_ it's cemented itself as an independent, professional platform for tech innovators.

Now, in it's **tenth** year ðŸ¤¯, the conference is bringing you premier data & cloud content with [tracks](https://www.scale.bythebay.io/about) on _Software Engineering_, _Cloud Architecture_, _Data & AI_, and _Open Source Science_.

One of the coolest parts? It's in a historic venue (the [Oakland Scottish Rite Center](https://oaklandscottishrite.com/)) with _a ton_ of charisma, or rizz, as the kids say these days.

I'll talk a bit about what has me the most excited.

## Speakers & Talks

There's quite a [start-studded lineup](https://www.scale.bythebay.io/speakers) for the conference, so I highly recommend you check out the full list of speakers, but the `TLDR` is that _Scale By the Bay_ will feature speakers from companies like Netflix, Disney, IBM, Databricks, and Confluent, covering topics ranging from _building LLMs_ to _data engineering best practices_.

Here are a few that stand out to me:

### LLM & AI

#### [Scaling Embeddings in Real-Time](https://www.scale.bythebay.io/post/zander-matheson-scaling-embeddings-in-real-time), Zander Matheson

Zander, the CEO of Bytewax (a Python-native, highly scalable, and cloud-native stream processing framework), knows a thing or two about streaming.

While generative AI is great, LLMs are only as powerful as their models, which often have to be updated or rebuilt.

In his talk, Zander will show us just how Bytewax can help to create scalable real-time embeddings, which can be used to power bespoke, generative AI pipelines _in real time_.

#### [Creating Context: Loading Your Life into a Vector Database](https://www.scale.bythebay.io/post/ben-church-creating-context-loading-your-life-into-a-vector-database), Ben Church

_Hello, World_ examples are great, but they're often not that fun or personal. In this talk, Ben Church of Airbyte will walk us through how to extract personal data, transform it into embeddings, and load it into a vector database, providing an LLM with domain-specific context to power your life/business.

### Streaming

#### [Latency Goes Sub-second in Apache Spark](https://www.scale.bythebay.io/post/karthik-ramasamy-latency-goes-sub-second-in-apache-spark-structured-streaming), Karthik Ramasamy

Perhaps a bit overshadowed by LLM & AI hype, streaming is still _all the rage_. What better opportunity to learn about streaming from the _Head of Streaming_ at Databricks?!

Karthik's talk will discuss improvements made in offset management to reduce Structured Streaming's inherent processing latency, primarily benefiting operational use cases like real-time monitoring. Evaluations show a latency improvement of 68-75%, reducing times from 700-900 ms to 150-250 ms at varied event throughputs.

### Data Best Practices

#### [Apache Iceberg: Enabling an Open-lakehouse Architecture for Analytics](https://www.scale.bythebay.io/post/dipankar-mazumdar-apache-iceberg-enabling-an-open-lakehouse-architecture-for-large-scale-analytics), Dipankar Mazumdar

I've written a bit about [Delta Lake](https://mattpalmer.io/posts/what-is-delta/) as a framework for enabling a [Lakehouse Architecture](https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=https://www.cidrdb.org/cidr2021/papers/cidr2021_paper17.pdf), but Iceberg is a similar format that has a host of benefits.

I think it's _super important_ that we _all_ keep up-to-date on the latest data tools & tech. I'm looking forward to this talk by Dipankar, a Developer Advocate at Dremio, to learn more about lakehouse architectures and how Iceberg differs from solutions like Delta.

#### [Your Pipeline as a Function: Applying Functional Programming Principles to Data Engineering](https://www.scale.bythebay.io/post/pete-hunt-your-pipeline-as-a-function-applying-functional-programming-principles-to-data-engineering), Pete Hunt

Software engineers are pretty smart. While there are some true data engineering ninjas out there, we can learn quite a bit from software engineering best practices.

That's why I'm excited to hear [Pete Hunt](https://twitter.com/floydophone), the CEO of Elementl, Inc. (the company behind [Dagster](https://dagster.io/)) talk about how we can apply functional principles to data engineering to build more resillient, scalable solutions.

### Meta

#### [Aging: Evolving Software, Tools, and Ourselves, Jeremy Smith](https://www.scale.bythebay.io/post/jeremy-smith-aging-evolving-software-tools-and-ourselves)

Every now & then, we need to get meta. [Jeremy Smith](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gentleman-and-a-scala/), a ML platform engineer at Netflix, is here to scratch that itch. I think the blurb speaks for itself:

> If it ain't broke, should you fix it? If it is broke, shouldn't you just rewrite it instead? Evolving software over years (and decades) isn't glamorous or exciting, but it's the necessary work that enables our field to create real economic value. How should we think about â€“ and plan for â€“ the ongoing evolution of our software? How can we know when to evolve and when to push back? When should we or shouldn't we throw it away and go green-field?
