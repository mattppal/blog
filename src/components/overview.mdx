# 👋 Hey there!

I work on problems in data, developer productivity, & personal growth. I often spend time thinking about developer tools, data systems, & the future of work. Sometimes I [draw flowers](/art), other times I do stuff outside or in a gym. I also have a newsletter called [CASE WHEN](https://newsletter.casewhen.xyz).
